# Get a restaurant app for your regular customers

With your app on their phones they'll see your logo every day!

With your own restaurant app you'll gain a valuable spot on your customers' phones, reminding them of their favourite takeaway every time they look at their screen.

And they will find ordering faster and easier than ever. Just what they want when they are feeling hungry on a Friday night!

We can make an app for your restaurant and give you full control over the display of your menu, opening times, promotions etc. In fact, if you have a FOODit website too, both will update together whenever you change any of these things in our Back Office system.

FOODit restaurant app is an affordable way to add another sales channel to your business, and we charge no ongoing fees for app maintenance or updates - these will all be free. There is simply a 10%+VAT commission charge on orders placed, the same as for orders from a FOODit website. If you're interested in both a restaurant website and app, speak to us about a package deal too!
